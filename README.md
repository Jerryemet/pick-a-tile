## Description:

Pick-A-Tile is a memory game where you have to match pairs of tiles of the same color. The game starts with a countdown timer and if you correctly match all the pairs within the time limit, you win. If the timer runs out before you complete the game, you lose.


## Getting Started:

2. Click on any tile to reveal its color.
3. Try to find a matching tile of the same color.
4. If you find a match, both tiles will remain visible.
5. If you don't find a match, both tiles will flip back over.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until you have matched all the pairs.
7. If you win, you will see a congratulatory message.
8. If you lose, you will see a message indicating that you ran out of time.
